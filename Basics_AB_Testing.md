### A/B testing in Python: Some Basics

A/B Testing also known as Multivariate Testing / Hypothesis Testing / Experimentation.
A/B testing is a decision-making methodology that allows to measure the impact of a change in a product. It helps us to figure out which metrics or user behavior change and how much they change. It also answers the question of is the change reliable.

The Key Characteristics of A/B Testing:   

--> Controlled Deliverate Experiment                                                                                                                                
--> Based on a randomized set of users                                                                                                                                                                    
--> Defined hypothesis and ability to measure success.                                                                                                                                                              
--> There is a controlled group with default experience and at least one test group with new experience.                                                                                                                          
Steps: 
1. Define a hypothesis
2. Decide how to design the feature.
3. Developer Build the feature
4. The data team determines how to measure the success of the feature.
5. Determine How to run the A/B testing:
   --> For how long do we run the A/B Testing?
   --> How many users do we want to assign to the test?
   --> How do we monitor the performance of the test? (Done by Data Science Team)
6. Analyzing the result.
7. After analyzing the result there are three decisions we can make:
 ** Iterate the test **
 ** Release to all users **
 ** Stop the test **
